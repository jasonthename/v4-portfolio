# A Guide to Subdomain Enumeration: From Passive to Active Methods

When you've acquired a target domain and want to expand your attack surface during a penetration test, subdomain enumeration becomes a crucial first step. This guide walks through various methods, from passive reconnaissance to active enumeration techniques.

## Passive Enumeration

Passive enumeration allows us to gather subdomain information without directly interacting with target servers. This stealthy approach avoids generating suspicious traffic to the target infrastructure.

### Google Dorking
Using Google's search operators can reveal subdomains with minimal effort:
- Use the `site:` operator (e.g., `site:example.com`)
- This method, while convenient, isn't always comprehensive

### DNS Dumpster [Site](https://dnsdumpster.com/)
DNS Dumpster provides detailed DNS enumeration including:
- MX records
- TXT records
- Host records

Note: Results may be limited as DNS Dumpster uses a static database.

### Security Trails [Site](https://securitytrails.com/dns-trails)
Security Trails offers:
- Current DNS records
- Historical DNS data
- Comprehensive subdomain mapping

### Certificate Transparency [Site](https://crt.sh/)
Leverage SSL/TLS certificate logs through crt.sh to:
- Find subdomains from certificate issuance records
- Discover historical subdomain information

## Active Enumeration

Active enumeration involves direct interaction with target infrastructure. This method requires proper authorization as it generates detectable traffic.

### Using Sublist3r
Sublist3r is a Python-based tool available for both Linux and Windows. Here's how to use it:

```bash
sublist3r -b -v -d hackerone.com
```

Flags explained:
- `-b`: Enable DNS brute force
- `-v`: Verbose output
- `-d`: Specify target domain

### GoBuster DNS Mode
While primarily known for directory brute forcing, GoBuster's DNS mode is effective for subdomain discovery.

Installation:
```bash
go install github.com/OJ/gobuster/v3@latest
```

Usage:
```bash
gobuster dns -d hackertarget.com -t 30 -w namelist.txt
```

Key parameters:
- `-t`: Number of threads (can be increased for faster results)
- `-w`: Wordlist path (recommended: SecLists' Discovery/DNS)

## Important Reminder

‚ö†Ô∏è **Always ensure you have proper authorization before performing any enumeration activities. Unauthorized testing can result in legal consequences.**
